<h3>Percy Jackson Series by Rick Riordan</h3>
    <p>
        This is a series based on Greek Mythology. 
        Percy Jackson finds out that he is the son 
        of Poseidon the God of the Seas. He then with 
        his friends go on many quests to stop Kronos 
        the Titan Lord from rising. I love this Series because 
        I find Greek Mythology very fascinating and
        this book is a really good read because it 
        is good to read about the different adventures 
        the heroes go on.

        This series is about a boy whos parents were murdered.
        He goes on to find out that he is a Wizard and 
        when he goes to Hogwarts (Magic School) he learns all
        types of Magic and finds out about his parents.
        This Series is very action-packed and it is one of the best books out there

    <h3>Liars By Jack Heath</h3>
    <p>
        This book is about a boy who creates a lie detector but many people believe that 
        the Lie Detector is rigged and they turn on him.
        If you like a good mystery book then this is for you.
